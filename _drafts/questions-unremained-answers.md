How to not degenerate into a conspiracy theorist.

1. Is determinism of space-time true? Does quantum mechanics refute it?

2. What is the crietrion for which a knowledge is "robust" across experiences?
Simply saying it's the intersection of things that people believe in is False

-> It's something like
1) you need to be able to explain why that's wrong
2) you need to be able to argue why your worldview is more comprehensive

3. 



practical empiricism
-- not necessarily discounting the role of genes,
but we need to find explanations at levels which we can reasonably intervene on
this is the antidote to the characteristic skepticism and pessimism of understanding
as espoused by the Chaos/complexity/complex systems view of the world.


The leap from animals to humans is asking the why question and being able to answer that.
this is honesty, and honesty feels good.
being true to oneself. being able to answer one's purpose.
