How to not degenerate into a conspiracy theorist.

1. Is determinism of space-time true? Does quantum mechanics refute it?

2. What is the crietrion for which a knowledge is "robust" across experiences?
Simply saying it's the intersection of things that people believe in is False
It's something like whether it is reasonably consistent with the experience/data

-> It's something like
1) you need to be able to explain why that's incorrect
2) you need to be able to argue why your worldview is more comprehensive

in other words, find a latent belief in the other's worldview that agrees with mine,
and then show that in order to be consistent, some beliefs must be upheld/discarded

really, to go back all the way, there are axioms that ANYBODY will agree to,
"learning is good"
"coherence is good?"
"generality is good?"

3. the problem of pessimism

4. the problem of negativity
can learning always feel good? Do we need negative experiences to learn?


man is first and foremost a learning animal
not a political animal

It is the philosophy of: despite!


the world is not harmonious in the way that it is "good"
it is harmonious simply in the way that it is "true"

the emphasis on truth is what separates us from good.
the church has failed in the advent of science--truth--separating itself from the church.


practical empiricism
-- not necessarily discounting the role of genes,
but we need to find explanations at levels which we can reasonably intervene on
this is the antidote to the characteristic skepticism and pessimism of understanding
as espoused by the Chaos/complexity/complex systems view of the world.


The leap from animals to humans is asking the why question and being able to answer that.
this is honesty, and honesty feels good.
being true to oneself. being able to answer one's purpose.
