What is a worldview, anyway?

Rather than define it hastily, I want to motivate why we would want to talk about something called worldviews in the first place.

#### Entrance 1 (attention):
I'm sure you've all had an experience where "something catches your attention." You could be reading a book, and a phrase would stand out among the lines. You're watching a movie, and a scene grabs your attention. Such experiences tend to last in long term memory, because they are literally "impressive" experiences. I imagine, almost anyone could testify to what kind of experience I'm talking about.

Really, it's nothing more than spontaneous attention. Oftentimes, people pay attention to similar things -- an "iconic scene" sometimes goes on to be a symbol shared by the whole community and beyond. But not always. A phrase that pierces through the heart of someone may as well be met by a blank stare from others.

But have you wondered -- how are we to explain this occasional convergence and divergence in attention? What is the difference that makes the difference in the people's reactions? What is the common ground that makes a scene special for everyone watching it? My proposal is that we need to talk about worldviews to explain this properly.

#### Entrance 2 (humor):
If that didn't help, let's try jokes. Imagine this: someone makes a joke -- the whole room laughs. But you just can't understand.

What happened here? Why did the joke achieve the intended effect (i.e. laughter) for others, but not you? What was the difference that caused the difference in reactions? Whatever our explanations are for each particular case, we cannot avoid positing some kind of interface, particular to each individual, through which the joke is taken in and processed ("digested", I'd say). We must be able to say both how the interfaces differed between individuals and how that difference led to the (partial) convergence and divergence in reactions. We would need to presuppose a common ground on which to compare and contrast such interfaces.

Valid explanations built on such common ground make use of differences in the beliefs, desires and intentions of each individual. It may be that the content of the joke was at disagreement with one of their beliefs, or someone might have found the joke too corny and dull, because they'd heard a similar joke before. In any case, the interface between the input (the joke) and the output (the reaction) is definitely doing some explanatory work here. I think we should call these interfaces "worldviews".

#### Option 3 (a cursory mathematical definition):
You might think we need a more principled definition of what a worldview is. I would love to give a precise mathematical definition, but unfortunately I can't. At the moment, all I can stand by is: worldviews are manifolds. Edmund Husserl (the founding philosopher of phenomenology, who BTW has a PhD in math) said in 1920, "Minds are mainfolds."

What kind of manifolds? It's not immediate.

#### Option 4 (hierarchy of beliefs):
why questions can reduce a belief to the fundamentals of worldviews. some beliefs constrain other beliefs, but only unidirectionally. What is this 

#### An ordering of beliefs?
