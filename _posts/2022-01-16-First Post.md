### What is the goal of this blog?

To push the vector of human collective will towards learning.
And frankly, to convince you that your goal should also be the same as mine.

### Why should one care to read this at all?
I really cannot answer this for you. But I am quite certain that you will learn at least one thing from reading this blog. Even if you already had thought of and agreed to everything written here, you will now also know that someone with my background thinks similarly to you (unless you were referred to this blog somehow and already know what I had to say). Granted, this blog probably contains completely incorrect statements, facts that may be refuted in 5, 50, 500 -- or whatever years. But this blog is less about the particular facts. It is about a theory surrounding how some important facts relate to each other via the medium of "worldviews." It also contains a hypothesis about why we're here. I think my theory is *true*, and my hypothesis, *quite plausible*. From this metacognitive belief stems my desire and hope to convince you of these ideas. If this makes you curious at all, great -- you've found a reason to read ahead!

### Propositions I wish to defend
Here is an unordered list of propositions that I would like to defend through my posts. I know that some of these may pique your immediate interest, while some others might sound way too vague and irrelevant to you. This list is, of course, far from perfect or complete, and always *subject to major revisions*. A secondary purpose of this blog is in fact to finetune these propositions to be more precise and revealing.

*Some day I should really find time to organize these in a more structured fashion.*

1. The only questions that have ramifications at all are what the True, the Good, and the Beautiful is.

2. The mind is naturalizable, i.e. explicable in non-mysterious, natural terms. In particular, the mind is best understood as a function of experience (the model is a function of data).

3. The biggest bottleneck in making progress has either been the lack of information or the lack of proper propagation of information.

4. Learning is good, no matter what.

5. I can only do, at best, to the best of what I know.

6. What elevates humans, and allows for the search of authenticity, is the primacy of the urge to learn -- the quest for Truth. Markedly human pursuits of Beauty and Good are reducible to the Truth.

7. Learning is explaining, learning is abstracting, learning is understanding.

8. Consciousness is possibly about three things: the input, the state, and the action of the organism. These correspond to questions of Beauty, Truth, and Good, in that order.

9. The cognitive pathway to learning is the act of asking the "why" question. There are two types of why questions: First, why are things the way they are? Second, why am I doing this?

10. Beauty is what lies between the conventional and the obscene.

11. Love is the first will towards Truth. It is "the desire to understand the other." On the same note, to will oneself free is to will others free. (Beauvoir)

12. Reinforcing negative value judgements -- whether aesthetic or moral -- are active suppressors of learning. Negative value judgements only aid learning when applied to oneself.

13. Truth requires two properties: generalizability-abstractedness and precision-correctness. An exemplary domain in which these two things are satisfied is the study of mathematics, that is at once highly abstract but also irrefutably precise.

14. Decisions are strictly better when made with more information. Decisions on what values we must strive for are no exception. A simple lesson from reinforcement learning.

15. Truth -- the generative model of spacetime -- is invariant. On the other hand, our sampling of spacetime, i.e. experience, is extremely variant and biased. In order to be robustly successful in the universe, any model must exploit invariances of the world to one's benefit.

16. Three components characterize intelligence: the discriminator, the generator and the actor. And yes, they correspond to Beauty, Truth, and Good.

17. Abstraction is the essence of the generator's function. It attempts to carve nature at its joints (Plato). It is at the core of what science should be.

18. Spacetime exists, and is deterministic. (Probably. Will have to learn more about this.) But determinism is the necessary condition for there to be free will in the correct sense.

19. A belief that is robust to a more diverse set of people, with a more diverse set of experiences, is closer to the truth. Social cognition is not only a means to get along with others, but also a crucial method to learn better about the world, by taking into account the perspective of others.

20. A single human individual is fundamentally constrained in the capacity to understand the universe. But at the same time, there is nothing that in principle limits humans from learning the truth. Every human being, in one way or another, acts to the best of their knowledge.

21. External conditions that threaten the continuity or stability of the organism constrain the desire for truth, and push it towards the pursuit of beauty and good in the visceral sense.

22. At least in the current regime of humans, their genes and their experiences, the variance among the data provided to the input causally explain the variance within models much better than the variance in genetic predispositions. This holds for any kind of variance within models, especially intelligence. Only after we have attained a reasonable amount of egalitarianism in the diversity of experiences and stability of conditions, will we be able to properly start asking questions of innateness. Before then, resorting to a person's "innate disposition" in explaining human behavior is nothing but a cowardly escape from the truth.

23. The primacy among the True, the Good, and the Beautiful is the ultimate question of human existence, and what humanity comes to agree upon will characterize the convergent state of human societies.

24. The closest humankind can get towards utopia is through a communitarianism of truth. A communist economic structure provides the necessary conditions toward such a society.

25. A single worldview can coherently defend all propositions above. Moreover, they must be defended altogether, at once.

26. Authenticity in belief leads to authenticity in action, that which can also be described as "self-discipline".

27. This worldview naturally gives birth to a will to reaffirm this worldview -- the goal of creating a world in which everyone learns more.

I will soon update with a list of unresolved questions, or other claims I would like to make but are wary to do so for various reasons at the moments. Along with the statements above, I welcome input and feedback on these statements as well.


#### **Disclaimer**
I presume many of you who have skimmed the above will be skeptical, either of the general attempt at such an all-sweeping scale, or at least of a number of specific propositions. And you are probably on the right side. One of the central tenets to appear in this blog is that *no single human* can understand everything. The set of information that a person may have access to over one's life is ineffably miniscule compared to the vast space of all possible knowledges. Crucially, this limitation applies to me as equally as to others. This means that although what is written here is earnestly my best attempt to gather the things I know into a coherent but understandable worldview, there may be (and will be) countless mistakes, misattributions, misrepresentations, and falsehoods about some facts of the world and people's views on them. I hope that this does not immediately extinguish your trust in reading this text.

*Rather, I want to ask you to try* -- if you agreed to what I have written down before you came across that paragraph that raised your eyebrows, is the error I made here actually damning to those past statements to which you nodded? If at first glance, this appears to be the case, must the whole set of statements that had thus been proposed be refuted? What are the statements that cannot be salvaged, and what are statements that hold nevertheless? If the error introduces a contradiction to statements you and I have agreed upon, can you *try to fix it*, by adding explanations that can both account for why I might have made that error, and why nevertheless other statements of the book must hold intact? And if you think you fixed it, or think you found an error so critical that my worldview can no longer stand, please let me know, because I would really love to know.

On a related note, one crucial consideration that any reader should be mindful when reading these blog posts (or any written work, for that matter) is to not overly fixate on what is written down. Of course, the content is what matters. But the reader should not focus on taking the statements written here at face value and assessing their merit independently. What must be understood is why the author chose that statement as opposed to a billion other possible statements, to follow the statements that came before, to be followed by the statements after. Assuming the author is good -- that is, honest -- in writing, focusing on how the text was generated is crucial to following the pathway, the train, the course, the transitions -- whatever you have it -- of thought that occurred in the author's mind as the author was generating the text. In machine learning terms (a phrase you will encounter countless times further into the blog), we may put this as follows: simply staring at the letters inscribed in black and white at best provides you with learning of the correlations among inputs. Communication at a more fundamental level occurs only when we learn, and more importantly, *attempt to learn* the generative model of the text. Quite antithetically, I must admit this was just a convoluted way of saying: please be understanding.

I am simply asking for the benefit of the doubt. I am honest when I say that I will only write here things that constitute my very best beliefs, both in terms of their scope of explanation and the consistency across them. Surely once you take a pass through it and fix the broken parts, the set of beliefs altogether will become more comprehensive and firmly grounded. I sincerely hope you find traversing through my blogs a pleasurable experience, in the sense that it opens up new avenues of learning for you.
