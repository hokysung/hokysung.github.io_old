What is the goal of this blog?

To push the vector of human collective will towards learning.

### Why should one care to read this at all?
I really cannot answer this for you.
But I am quite certain that you will learn at least one thing from reading this blog. Even if you already had thought of and agreed to everything written here, you will now also know that someone with my background thinks similarly to you (unless you were referred to this blog somehow and already know what I had to say). This blog probably contains completely incorrect statements, facts that may be refuted in 5, 50, 500 -- or whatever years. But this blog is less about the particular facts. It is about a hypothesis surrounding how some important facts relate to each other. It also contains a hypothesis about why we're here. I think my first hypothesis is **true** in the firmest sense, and my second hypothesis, *quite plausible*. From here stems my desire and my hope to convince you of these ideas. If you are curious, please read ahead.

### Preliminariess
One of the central tenets to appear in this blog is that **no single human** can understand everything. The set of information that a person may have access to over one's life is ineffably miniscule compared to the vast space of all possible knowledges. Crucially, this limitation applies to me as equally as to others. This means that although what is written here is earnestly my best attempt to gather the things I know into a coherent but understandable worldview, there may be (and will be) countless mistakes, misattributions, misrepresentations, and falsehoods about some facts of the world and people's views on them. I hope that this does not immediately extinguish your trust in reading this text.

*Rather, I want to ask you to try* -- if you agreed to what I have written down before you came across that paragraph that raised your eyebrows, is the error I made here actually damning to those past statements to which you nodded? If at first glance, this appears to be the case, must the whole set of statements that had thus been proposed be refuted? What are the statements that cannot be salvaged, and what are statements that hold nevertheless? If the error introduces a contradiction to statements you and I have agreed upon, can you *try to fix it*, by adding explanations that can both account for why I might have made that error, and why nevertheless other statements of the book must hold intact? And if you think you fixed it, or think you found an error so critical that my worldview can no longer stand, please let me know, because I would really love to know.

On a related note, one crucial consideration that any reader should be mindful when reading these blog posts (or any written work, for that matter) is to not overly fixate on what is written down. Of course, the content is what matters. But the reader should not focus on taking the statements written here at face value and assessing their merit independently. What must be understood is why the author chose that statement as opposed to a billion other possible statements, to follow the statements that came before, to be followed by the statements after. Assuming the author is good -- that is, honest -- in writing, focusing on how the text was generated is crucial to following the pathway, the train, the course, the transitions -- whatever you have it -- of thought that occurred in the author's mind as the author was generating the text. In machine learning terms (a phrase you will encounter countless times further into the blog), we may put this as follows: simply staring at the letters inscribed in black and white at best provide you with learning of the correlations among inputs. Communication at a more fundamental level occurs only when we learn, and more importantly, **attempt to learn** the generative model of the text. Quite antithetically, I must admit this was just a convoluted way of saying: please be understanding.

I am simply asking for the benefit of the doubt. I am honest when I say that what is written down here constitute my very best beliefs, both in terms of their scope of explanation and the consistency across them. Surely once you take a pass through it and fix the broken parts, the set of beliefs altogether will become more comprehensive and firmly grounded.
