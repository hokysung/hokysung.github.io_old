Welcome! I'm Hokyung Sung, a graduate student studying Computational Psychology.

I believe that **learning is good**, in all senses and scales of the words *learning* and *good*. And I take it that anyone that reads the sentence above will agree. Naturally, my goal is to push the vector of collective human will towards learning.

To do this well, I want to first better characterize how the mind works. That's why I'm studying algorithms of curiosity right now as a Master's student in Dr. Dan Yamins's Lab at Stanford University. To build better computational models of the mind, I've applied to PhD programs in neuro- and cognitive sciences this application season.

Have fun looking around the blog!
